This data Pipeline was one of my biggest projects where we automated a lot of process by using Python,Pandas,Hadoop,Teradata and much more.

The pipeline creates a data Warehouse in AWS, for obvious reasons all the business logics have been hidden and variables names covered.

It also features a brand new security-app created by me which protects the user when running the pipelines by storing their credentials under windows password management using a hash-key-value system to retrieve the password all in the backend.
